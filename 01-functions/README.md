# The Calculator - Exercise on functions

1. Clone or download this repository
2. 🖩 Implement a calculator in `scripts.js`. 
3. 👀 Have a look at reference.js for a summary of the possibilities of functions
4. 🧪 Test your application:
    1. Open index.html in Chrome
    2. Open devtools (f12 / cmd+option+i)
    3. Try it out: `calculator(1,2).add()`

**Extra:**

1. 🐛 What happens when you run `calculator(1,0).divide()`? Provide a user friendly message.
2. 🕐 Keep history of the last 10 operations.
3. Write a `calculator().previous(n)` function, which runs the n-last operation.
