/*
Goal:
Create a class hierarchy for vehicles, starting with a generic Vehicle class and extending it to include specific types of vehicles like Car and Truck. 
You will progressively add functionality, such as properties, methods, inheritance, and access modifiers.

Step 1: Create the Base Class
Start by creating a base Vehicle class with basic properties and methods.

Step 2: Add a Derived Class
Create a Car class that inherits from the Vehicle class and adds a new property, such as numberOfDoors.

Step 3: Add Access Modifiers
Add private and protected properties to control access to certain data. Introduce a Truck class and demonstrate the use of protected.

Step 4: Add Static Properties and Methods
Add a static method to the Vehicle class to count the number of vehicles created.

Expected final output:

This vehicle is a Generic Brand from 2020.
This car is a Toyota from 2021 with 4 doors.
This truck is a Ford from 2019 with a cargo capacity of 10 tons.
The truck is now loaded with a capacity of 10 tons.
Total vehicles created: 2
