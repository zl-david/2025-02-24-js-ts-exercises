 * Exercise: Event Management System
 *
 * Build an application (no UI) where users can register for events, organisers can manage events, administrators can generate reports.
 * - TsDD
 * - keep state at runtime.
 * - Call functions in a specific sequence to test your code
 *
 * Try to include as much of the concepts as possible:
 * - [ ] Union types
 * - [ ] Type aliasses
 * - [ ] Type predicates
 * - [ ] Generics
 * - [ ] Utility (e.g. Partial, Omit, ...)
 * - [ ] Intersection type
 * - [ ] Function Overload
 * - [ ] as const
 *
 * Methods you can implement:
 * - registerUser()
 * - createEvent()
 * - getUserRole()
 * - filterEvents()
 * - getEventById()
 * - updateEvent()
 * - assignUserToEvent()
 * - findEvent()
 * - isEventOrganizer()
 * - generateReport()
 *
 * Things to consider:
 * - Can you use "Opaque" types somewhere?
 * - Did you check permission for every function? How would you model the current user executing the functions?
